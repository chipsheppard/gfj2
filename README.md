Hi. I used to be a starter theme called `_s`, or `underscores`. 

I'm now a theme made specifically for an awesome jewelry store created by my good friends Roger and Maddie.

This theme uses Bootstrap v3.2.0 (http://getbootstrap.com).

== ChangeLog ==

= 1.0.0 - 05 2024 =
* Copied good-fortune-jewelry -> GFJ
* Customized according to client requests
